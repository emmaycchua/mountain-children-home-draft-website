# mountain-children-home-draft-website

## Description

This is a simple website I built as a practice project to showcase Mountain Children Home, an orphanage located in Dadagaun, Nepal. The site introduces the home, shares the stories of the children and caretakers, and provides ways for visitors to get involved or contact them.
