            <h2>About Mountain Children Home</h2>
            <p>Mountain Children Home is a place of warmth, joy, and laughter, but life for the 32 children who live there is not easy.</p>
            <br>
            <p>They all came to Mountain Home at a young age when they lost both of their parents and no other relatives took them in. As soon as they stepped foot into Mountain Home though, they were no longer alone. But they still brave untold challenges:</p>
            <ul class="challenges-list">
                <li>Hour-long walks to school through a night-time jungle</li>
                <li>A catastrophic earthquake that flattened their home</li>
                <li>Constant food and financial insecurity</li>
            </ul>

                        <p class="description">Ramesh founded Mountain Children Home in 2002 after seeing 
                            the need for a safe haven for orphaned children in the region. 
                            He started this home because he had experienced the hardships of being orphaned 
                            at a young age. He has taken more than 150 children under his wing and raised them as his own, 
                            fighting against all odds to provide them with a loving family and an education, 
                            while raising them as compassionate and independent people.</p>

                        <p class="description">Gita acts as a motherly figure to each child at the Mountain Children Home, 
                            offering not just care, but genuine love and emotional support. She ensures that every child is well-fed 
                            with nutritious meals, often preparing food herself. Beyond physical well-being, 
                            Gita takes a personal interest in each child's educationâ€”regularly checking in on their progress, encouraging
                            them to stay motivated, and celebrating their academic achievements.</p>

                            He cares deeply about the success of Mountain Children Home and hopes to take over when Ramesh retires. 
                            He is already a crucial part of the running of the orphanage and 
                            handles many tasks such as managing the finances, liaising with donors and running errands for the home 
                            down in Kathmandu valley. He acts as an older brother to the children and enjoys playing games with them.</p>
