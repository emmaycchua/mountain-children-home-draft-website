            <p>Mountain Children Home is an orphanage based in Dadagaun, Nepal. There are 30+ children living in the home at all times, and the children who currently reside there range from ages 4 to 23. Some have already finished their education and have entered the working world but have chosen to stay at Mountain Home to help their younger siblings. They all have their own hopes and dreams - from being engineers and footballers to being dancers and barista - but one thing they all have in common is that they are hard-working, kind-hearted children.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>Why They Need Your Help</h2>
            <p>The children receive no help from the Nepalese government and are completely reliant on the occasional donation to support their large family. They have no financial security and only very limited resources which leaves them extremely vulnerable in states of emergency. Last year, their water filtration system broke down which left them drinking unclean water.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>These children understand a better education is essential for them to be independent and to stand on their own two feet. Therefore, they give their education their all. Recently, the younger children received their school test results - from kindergarten to grade 7, all the children at their school who came in first place were from Mountain Home.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>This is no small feat, given all the odds stacked against them. With just a little help from you, they can unlock their full potential to achieve great things.</p>
